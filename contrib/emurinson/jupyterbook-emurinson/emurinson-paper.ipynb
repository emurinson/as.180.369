    "\n",
    "This paper analyzes the efficacy of consumer sentiment as an economic indicator through two primary modes. First, we investigate whether consumer sentiment shifts for reasons that are not necessarily justifiable by a strictly rational analysis of the economic circumstances. To do this, we undertake a survey of the literature connected to the topic of irrational expectations and sentiment. Next, we perform a regression analysis of economic sentiment from the University of Michigan Survey against several different indicators of political party in power to test a relationship between positive consumer sentiment and political party in control. Second, we address the following question: to the extent that consumer sentiment shifts due to irrational expectations, how substantive of an effect does that have on actual economic behavior that affects macroeconomic trends. To do this, we run a further regression analysis of consumer sentiment data versus later consumer spending, inflation data, and employment data. We find that, often, economic actors alter their economic outlook, even irrationally, based on factors such as political party, employment status, and age. As a result, consumer spending is consistently affected proportionately to consumer sentiment. This, in turn, affects larger macroeconomic trends like inflation, employment, and GDP growth. \n",

    "Economic indicators play an important role in nearly all forms of economic analysis. For many of them, what they represent is clear and the relationship they inform us about is easily identified. Take, for instance, GDP. GDP represents the total output produced by all domestic producers in an economy. Because of this, economists can analyze its fluctuations to derive the level of growth in any economy at a given time. Other economic indicators, however, are less straightforward. Consumer sentiment is one of them. \n",
    "\n",
    "Gross Domestic Product, or GDP, is composed of four primary elements: household spending, investment, government spending, and net exports. In recent years, consumer spending has accounted for around 70% of total GDP (https://apps.bea.gov/iTable/?reqid=19&step=2#reqid=19&step=2&isuri=1&1921=survey). As a result, any data we can leverage to help predict trends in consumer spending becomes vastly important in determining overall economic well-being. Since the early 1960's when the University of Michigan's Survey of Consumers was inaugurated, economists and policymakers in the U.S. have generally referred to it and similar measures of consumer sentiment to model their predictions for future consumer spending\n",
    "Consumer sentiment metrics reflect the collective emotions, expectations, and behaviors of consumers and holds the power to shape economic trajectories. However, what if these sentiments are not entirely rational? What if they are influenced by factors such as political affiliation, employment status, or other external variables, resulting in irrational expectations that have far-reaching implications for the economy?\n",
    "\n",
    "This research paper embarks on a journey to unravel the intricate relationship between consumer sentiment and irrational expectations. We aim to shed light on how these irrationalities, often rooted in psychological biases, can significantly impact consumer behavior, consequently shaping macroeconomic trends.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consumer sentiment is not solely determined by objective economic indicators but is often swayed by subjective perceptions and psychological biases. Political affiliation, for instance, can lead individuals to either overly pessimistic or optimistic sentiments based on their political beliefs. Similarly, employment status can cause individuals to view economic conditions through a biased lens, leading to actions that may not align with the objective reality. By delving into these aspects, we seek to understand the extent to which consumer sentiment is influenced by irrational expectations and how this affects actual economic behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "This paper recognizes the interconnectedness of consumer sentiment with larger macroeconomic trends, such as inflation, employment, and GDP growth. The hypothesis posits that shifts in consumer sentiment, driven by irrational expectations, have substantive and proportionate effects on consumer spending, which, in turn, ripple through the economic system, impacting these macroeconomic indicators.\n",
    "\n",
    "Statistical data and scholarly research underline the interdependence of consumer sentiment and consumer spending. A study conducted by Ludvigson found that changes in consumer sentiment correlated significantly with changes in consumer spending patterns. Consumer sentiment was described as a \"leading indicator of economic behavior,\" with fluctuations in sentiment consistently preceding changes in consumption patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "In conclusion, this research paper endeavors to explore the multifaceted relationship between consumer sentiment, irrational expectations, and their impact on macroeconomic trends. By examining the role of psychological biases, political affiliation, and employment status in shaping consumer sentiment, we aim to provide valuable insights into understanding and predicting economic behavior. Moreover, through empirical evidence and scholarly quotations, we will substantiate the notion that consumer sentiment is a linchpin in the dynamics of the macroeconomy, influencing inflation, employment, and GDP growth in profound ways. This exploration promises to deepen our comprehension of the intricate workings of the economy and guide policymakers in crafting informed decisions for a more stable and prosperous future.\n"

    "\n",
    "Consumer sentiment indices have been shown to be predictive of consumer spending and economic activity in a number of studies. Shapiro (2022){cite:t}`SHAPIRO2022221` demonstrated that the University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment Index has significant predictive power on consumer spending, finding that a one-point increase in the index is associated with a $20 billion increase in real personal consumption expenditures. Further analysis showed that consumer sentiment predicts spending even when controlling for other macroeconomic factors like household income and unemployment. These results align with findings by Ludvigson (2004){cite:t}`spending_ludvigson`, who established the Consumer Sentiment Index as a statistically significant predictor of consumer demand. Through regression analysis, Ludvigson found consumer sentiment to be a key driver of consumption growth in the U.S., with a one-point rise being associated with a 1.3% increase in personal consumption.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, more recent research indicates consumer sentiment may be influenced by factors unrelated to actual economic conditions. De Boef and Kellstedt (2004){cite:t}`deboef_2004` uncovered evidence that political partisanship significantly impacts consumer sentiment reports. In analyzing survey data, they found respondents identifying as Democrats reported substantially lower consumer sentiment following the 2000 election of President Bush, despite no notable changes in macroeconomic indicators. This suggests partisan bias can cause sentiment reports to diverge from real-world economic statistics. Relatedly, Hollanders and Vliegenthart (2011){cite:t}`HOLLANDERS2011367` demonstrated that negative media coverage of the economy decreases consumer confidence, even when economic fundamentals remain unchanged. Through a time-series analysis, they found increased negative economic news coverage was associated with deteriorating consumer sentiment during the 1990s economic expansion.\n",
    "\n",
    "Taken together, these studies indicate that while consumer sentiment gauges can strongly predict consumer behavior, the indices themselves may be impacted by individuals' subjective perceptions and biases. As a result, sentiment measures may overstate or understate the link between sentiment and future consumption. The findings highlight the need for caution in interpreting consumer confidence measures and underscore the complex psychological factors that influence people's economic outlooks and choices. More research is warranted to better understand these motivations driving consumer sentiment as well as how best to extract the true economic signal from noisy survey data. Integrating sentiment indices with other economic indicators and modeling techniques may allow for more accurate predictions of consumer behavior.\n",

    "The Parker paper examines how investors with different political affiliations adjusted their portfolio allocations in response to the unexpected outcome of the 2016 US presidential election. The key findings are:\n",
    "\n",
    "Republicans became more optimistic and increased the equity share of their portfolios relative to Democrats following the election. This effect holds even after controlling for differences in income, wealth, demographics, local economic conditions, etc.\n",
    "The results are driven by active rebalancing decisions, not just passive appreciation of existing holdings. Price-constant portfolios that remove valuation changes show the same patterns.\n",
    "The effects are concentrated among a small subset of investors who made large (25%+) changes to their equity allocations. Most investors did not actively trade in response to the election outcome.\n",
    "The portfolio reallocations are consistent with survey evidence showing Republicans became more optimistic and Democrats more pessimistic about future US economic performance after the election.\n",
    "Trading volume increased after the election, supporting models where public events cause heterogeneous belief updating and disagreements that induce trading.\n",
    "Overall the findings suggest investors interpret public signals through the lens of their political identity, updating their beliefs and trading accordingly even though asset prices don't fully reflect their individual views.\n",
    "In summary, the paper provides evidence that differences in beliefs linked to political affiliation help explain investor portfolio choice using the 2016 election as an exogenous shock to beliefs.\n",

    "Carroll Paper Summary: \n",
    "\n",
    "The Carroll paper examines whether consumer sentiment indexes have predictive power for future changes in household consumption expenditures. The key findings are:\n",
    "\n",
    "Lagged values of the University of Michigan Index of Consumer Sentiment (ICS) have explanatory power for current changes in total personal consumption expenditures as well as expenditures on goods and services. The ICS indexes explain around 5-20% of the variation in consumption growth.\n",
    "The ICS indexes contain some incremental predictive information beyond other macroeconomic variables like income growth, interest rates, and stock prices. However, much of the predictive power is shared with these other variables.\n",
    "The predictive ability of sentiment cannot be fully explained by a model where some consumers follow a rule-of-thumb of consuming their current income. Sentiment appears to have a direct effect on consumption separate from predicting income.\n",
    "The results suggest consumer sentiment partly reflects expectations about future income but also contains independent information relevant for consumption decisions. Sentiment may proxy for uncertainty or consumer confidence not captured in other variables.\n",
    "In summary, the paper provides evidence that consumer sentiment surveys have real predictive content for household spending growth in the US. Sentiment indexes likely measure a combination of expectations, uncertainty, confidence and other factors that influence consumption beyond current and expected income.\n",

    "## Results\n",
    "\n",
    "In our study, we conducted two different groups of regressions: one probing the relationship between political party in power and the index of consumer sentiment nationally in the United States, and a second investigating the relationship between consumer sentiment and lagged economic indicators like aggregate consumer spending, the inflation level, and the unemployment level. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Across the three studies, there is evidence that consumer sentiment is not always a rational forecast of future economic conditions. Specifically, Carroll, Fuhrer, and Wilcox (1994) find that consumer sentiment exhibits excess optimism and pessimism at times relative to underlying economic fundamentals. They demonstrate spikes in the Index of Consumer Sentiment that are not justified by economic indicators like unemployment, inflation, and stock prices. Further, they show that media reporting on the economy appears to drive some of these swings in sentiment beyond what economic activity warrants.\n",
    "\n",
    "Despite sentiment not always aligning with rational expectations, the studies suggest consumer sentiment has predictive power for consumer spending. Carroll et al. (1994) employ reduced form regressions and find lagged consumer sentiment indexes can explain over 10% of the variation in future spending growth, even controlling for economic factors. The paper argues this predictive ability lends credence to sentiment containing meaningful information on expectations. Similarly, Carroll (2003) uses time-series regressions and shows that high media coverage of inflation raises the frequency at which consumers update their inflation expectations, in turn influencing spending.\n",
    "\n",
    "The methodologies used to relate sentiment and spending differ across the studies. Carroll et al. (1994) estimate reduced form models regressing spending growth on lags of sentiment indexes and economic controls. They test predictive ability out-of-sample and examine subcomponents of spending. Carroll (2003) specifies a time-varying parameter model where the frequency of expectation updates depends on media coverage. Identification relies on exogenous spikes in inflation news. Finally, Parker et al. (2018) employ a natural experiment approach exploiting the 2016 election surprise. Using administrative portfolio data, they demonstrate political affiliation predicts different responses of asset allocations to the same public news shock.\n",
    "\n",
    "In conclusion, these studies consistently point to consumer sentiment exhibiting excess volatility not explained by economic fundamentals. However, sentiment does appear to contain meaningful signals that help predict future spending and economic behavior. The evidence suggests consumers do not fully incorporate all available information into their expectations in a Bayesian manner. Overall, incorporating measures of consumer psychology and media influence improves models of expectations and spending compared to purely rational frameworks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Results implicated from Doms article : Doms demonstrate that the news cycle affects consumer sentiment in an irrational way through the following methods:\n",
    "\n",
    "They show spikes in the volume of negative news coverage (recession and layoff mentions) during the early 1990s recession that are much greater than warranted based on economic fundamentals like GDP, unemployment, etc. Sentiment dropped sharply during this period as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using time series regressions, they find that increases in their recession and layoff news indexes are associated with statistically significant declines in consumer sentiment indexes, even after controlling for economic factors. This suggests media pessimism directly lowered sentiment beyond what economic activity warranted.\n",
    "\n",
    "They estimate a nonlinear time-varying parameter model where the frequency with which consumers update expectations depends on the volume of economic news coverage. Their model indicates that consumers update expectations more frequently during periods of high media coverage, causing sentiment to shift more rapidly.\n",
    "During periods of low news volume, sentiment is fairly persistent and not responsive to economic changes. But high news volume makes sentiment much more variable. This excess volatility relative to economic fundamentals demonstrates the irrational influence of media coverage on sentiment.\n",
    "\n",
    "Through constructing media content indexes, regression analysis, and nonlinear time-varying models, the authors provide strong evidence that the tone and volume of economic media coverage affects consumer sentiment in excess of what is justified by actual economic conditions. This influence makes sentiment more volatile and disconnected from rational expectations."
